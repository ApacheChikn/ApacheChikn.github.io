                                <h5 class="mb-1">Good morning, Doctor Adamson.</h5>
                                
                                <p>Doing this homework, writing down these experiences and thoughts, was difficult for me. YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I HAVE EVER SHARED number 13 with. I wrote number 13 because I need someone to understand why I say I'm inadequate. It goes along with the rest of the list. I won't go into any physical description, just a sharing of my experiences. My explanation for bringing it up is at the end of number 13.</p>
                                <p>This will take a few minutes to read. It took me 20 minutes. We can end the meeting early, so you can get back your time.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>I have two sisters in AA. They told me step 5 is to confess to another human being. I always said I would never go into a 12-step program, or confess to another person, ever. I confess to God only. Well, today I am going to try confessing (telling my story) to another human being, some of my most embarrassing and tragic experiences. I wrote it down, because I didn't think I could go through with it in our session. This is easier for me.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Please keep in mind there are other core beliefs I could have addressed. I chose this one because four other core beliefs are encompassed in this one. This isn't the only core belief I gave a 5 to. Let's get started.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="position-relative mb-4">

                                <p>A core belief I want to change: I AM INADEQUATE.</p>
                                <p>This one core belief covers these other core beliefs, which I gave a 5 to.</p>
                                    <p>I am unwanted.</p>
                                    <p>I am rejected.</p>
                                    <p>I am undesirable.</p>
                                    <p>I'm unattractive.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I am unemployed, in debt, and have a history of substance abuse, and mental health issues, and I haven't accumulated anything tangible or intangible.</small></p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">04: I have nothing to offer/</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2">I'm just a 'nice guy', and that's worthless. I get stepped on because of it. I get taken advantage of because of it. And, I got used to it. I know I'm being taken advantage of. I'm just desperate. Plus, I'm always crying. Who wants to be with a man who cries all the time?</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I went to jail and lost the motel room I was staying in for the past 2 years. As soon as the people on whom I rely run out of generosity, I'll be in a shelter.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I am codependent and do whatever someone wants of me. I get lied to, but I am so glad to have companionship that I put up with it. I put up with things I shouldn't because I am pathetic.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I have failed at life. I'm not worth making a personal investment in. Seriously, who would want to have a relationship with someone who does nothing but fail?</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">People can tell when someone is desperate for friendship, or an intimate relationship. It turns them off. They don't want to attempt a friendship, or a relationship, because they think I will be clingy.</p>

                                <p>My mother told me more than once, when I was a child, "You will end up alone. You're going to be a hermit".</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">I am putting my family, and friends, in a situation where I have had to depend on them for way too long. I think they are running out of patience and generosity.</p>

I brought this up the last time we met because it is evidence for the statement, "I am inadequate." If you begin reading it and find it uncomfortable, or an unacceptable topic, we can skip it. If you think we discussed it enough last time to understand why I say the things I say about myself, go ahead and skip clicking the button. If you do click the button, click it twice.

It took awhile for me to catch on to what she meant. <br><br>When I was on the swim team in high school we had to wear speedos. You couldn't tell I was a boy. I looked like a female in a bikini bottom. I was on the swim team for three years and was often made fun of for it every year. <br><br>My first experience with sexual intercourse was with my girlfriend, Eleanor Morna Palmer. She had already been sexual with her last boyfriend, so she had some experience. When we started having sex she would always ask if I was inside her, because she couldn't feel me. We had sex a couple of times and then she broke up with me. <br><br>Then I left for the Marine Corps boot camp, and during the 16 weeks of training, my new girlfriend broke up with me. When I returned home and found out we weren't a couple anymore, I learned she had told everyone about how she put up with my -tiny dick for too long-. <br><br>While in boot camp, we all had to shower together. It was obvious how insignificant I was below. I had a chance to see other men naked, and I was completely embarrassed. Some would point and laugh. I would try to turn and hide myself. <br><br>When I was on the U.S.S. Iwo Jima doing a Mediterranean Float, another Marine had been watching me when I showered. He came up to me when I was drying myself off. I stood up to let him go past me, but he grabbed my penis and balls and said, -Ain't that so cute-. I just froze, like I was back in the foster home. I was so embarrassed that he made a comment like my exgirlfriends would. It was discovered later that he was gay, and was having sex with a sailor in the Fan Room on ship. As far as I know, they both were taken off the ship and discarged. <br><br>Once I got out of the Marine Corps, I met girls in college. Some of the girls I dated were downright rude. One time I was close to having a one-night stand. We met at the bar. We left and went to my apartment. We got undressed together. When she saw me naked, she giggled and started getting dressed. I asked her what was wrong. She said, -I can't go through with it, because I can't do anything with that-, pointing at my penis. I gave her a ride back to her dorm and left feeling humiliated. <br><br> A girl I was seeing in college, Leslie Hagler, took me to a party at her friends house, which was a three hours drive from Mobile. We were going to spend the night, because of the distance. I had gotten drunk, went to bed, and passed out. Leslie pulled down the sheets from over me, then slipped my underwear off, while I was passed out. She played some very loud music, which woke me up, and there she was with two of her girlfriends, standing there looking at me, and laughing. I heard Leslie say, -See, I told you. It's small.-<br><br>My girlfriend, Gale, whom I had been dating for roughly three months came to me and asked for an open relationship. I asked why, and she said I was a really nice guy. I gave her everything, but satisfaction in bed. She said she was sorry, but needed that. I could tell she had a hard time telling me. I believed her, and I understood. I told her I wasn't going to have an open relationship. It would be too painful for me to think that someone else is having sex with her. I said she should just break up with me and go her way. She stayed another two weeks, until I found out she was cheating on me. I ended the relationship. <br><br>The last two girlfriends I had were black women. They both commented to me that -they knew white guys were small, but not that small-. I ignored the comment because I was so desperate to have someone in my life. <br><br>The first one was, Cathlean Charmaine Robinson. She had a serious drinking problem. We worked together in an Industrial Plant. I always walked through the plant looking down at the floor. I felt invisible most of the time. One day Cathlean walked passed me as I was looking down and walking to the break room. I heard, -Hi Shawn- in the sweetest voice. When I looked up, her smile melted my heart. I looked for her after my break, and asked for her phone number. She gave it to me, and we talked on the phone a few times, before we started meeting after work. She was in a bad situation. She had received two DUI's in one week. She was spending her weekends in jail, and she couldn't afford a lawyer. She bounced around from couch to couch, like I'm doing right now. I offered her an opportunity. I told her I was lonely, and I liked her company. I would help her financially if she would spend more time with me. She accepted my offer. We spent enough time together enough I went to kiss her one evening, and she jumped back shocked. She didn't allow it. I told her I was interested in her physically. She wasn't interested, because she wanted her freedom, and thought I would be too clingy. But, she did engage in sex with me a few weeks later. We got undressed together and she looked at me like -WTF-. She said, -I know I'm not going to get anything out of this, but come on let's get it over with.- I was embarrassed and felt like a loser. She ended up making excuses for not coming over anymore. She stopped seeing me. <br><br>The second black woman was Shavonne Elaine Giles. She was a cook at the Waffle House not too far from where I was staying. I would eat there often. We hit it off and started seeing each. She made me feel wanted. I had been alone for a few years by then. It was a couple of months into the relationship before we got into the physical part of the relationship. She was immediately disappointed with me sexually. We ended up shopping for adult toys shortly after our first time together, she insisted. The size of the toys she would pick out made me feel like shit. It was all she ever wanted me to use on her from then on. I always felt bad about myself because I couldn't do more for her. Sometimes she didn't even reciprocate sexually. We stayed together for over a year. I think it lasted that long because I was paying her rent, and buying her groceries. I ended up buying a second car, so she could drive herself to work instead of paying for rides. The relationship ended shortly after the car purchase. I allowed her to use the car for a few weeks to get herself settled into using public transportation. She never returned the car. <br><br>My mother commented to me once by saying, -You'll never get a girlfriend with that- pointing to my penis. I was 10 and wearing one of her wigs, running around naked in the house, just being a kid. She took a polariod of me and would show her friends when they came over. The comments I heard always made me cry. I never ran around unclothed again. <br><br> There were several times in my life that I considered having my testicles cut off to stop testosterone production, which would kill my libido, which would stop me from seeking out physical romantic relationships. A couple of times I even tied string around them to make them hurt because I hated myself. I would stand in front of a mirror and tell myself -No one will ever want to be with you. You'll always be used and a loser-. <br><br>Doctor, it's important to understand the evidence. These aren't simply hurtful remarks said out of spite to hurt me. Also, you had a difficult time believing that someone would do such things to another person. They do, and worse. I don't sit around hating on the women who hurt me. I hate on myself. <br><br> I hope I was clear, and respectful.<br><br>Thank you for understanding. If I offended you, I am sorry. I need someone to understand why I am, where I am. It's not the only thing that bothers me, though. <br><br> When you get to number 14, scroll back up to the BUTTON you clicked to make this text disappear.";

                                <p>Here's my problem with telling myself positive thoughts. Why am I supposed to accept compliments as true and insults as false? I'm tired of being told that the negative comments are to be ignored, and the compliments are to be accepted (except from you, Doctor, your input I accept as truth). Chances are, the negative comments are the truest. Compliments are phony. How can someone who doesn't know me ever give me a genuine compliment? They can't. If I haven't EARNED compliments, then they are not real. They shouldn't just be handed out. You may ask why that doesn't apply to negative comments. People don't have to know someone very well to make a negative comment.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">LONELINESS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>I'm not new to loneliness. Most of my life I have felt lo,neliness. If I had to guess when I first felt loneliness, I would say when I was removed from my home and put in a group home. I was separated from my mother and 3 sisters. I was 4 years old. I wasn't in the group home long before a foster family took me in. I spent a short period of time in the first home, before I was placed in another home, where my sisters were. Apparently, it wasn't easy to find a foster family that would take 4 children at once. My youngest sister was around 6 months old. We spent 2 years with the foster family. Really bad things happened in that time.</p>
                                <p>The foster family consisted of Martha, Eddy and Eddy Jr. Then there was us four. And, from time to time at least one or two other kids would cycle through for a day to a week. One of the kids that came through molested me. I was four and he was twelve. He liked to watch wrestling on tv and then act like he was a wrestler. Several times he pinned me down on my stomach with my arms back between his knees, so I couldn't move. He was bigger, stronger, and heavier than me. Then he would lay on my back enough to pull my underwear down. He would rub his penis into my butt cheeks. Sometimes he would penetrate my ass. He would always ejaculate on my butt cheeks before he got off of me, telling me I better not say anything. I frozen until he left, but eventually I would pull up my underwear and feel this sticky stuff on my ass. I thought he had spit on me, until I was older and truly understood what he did. He was caught molesting me by Martha and she had him removed from the home. After he left it came to light that he had also been molesting Eddy Jr. (by sticking his penis in Eddy's mouth) and my oldest sister (who didn't tell me until we were in our 30's). I was always angry with my parents for putting me in that home and then abandoning me.</p>
                                <p>Every time I returned home from a deployment while in the Marine Corps, I felt loneliness. Not one time was anyone waiting for me to return. It always hurt being alone.</p>
                                <p>I have felt loneliness for most of my life, consistently every day. It causes me pain I imagine is equivalent to a heart attack. It causes me to cry, so I find a place that's private and cry, while telling myself I'm worthless and stupid. That's because I am.</p>

Growing up I was taken care of like the family dog. I had shelter, food, clothing, and nothing was ever expected of me. I was told to move out after I graduated from high school. I wasn't encouraged to do anything or become anything. I didn't let anyone down.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I lived in Mobile, Alabama, I went to Mardi Gras every year. One year, all my friends called it a night and went home. I drove one friend home then went back to the party, in downtown Mobile. I pulled up in front of a bar, and parked my car. A homeless man staying in the park across the street approached me. He asked if he could sit in my car to stay warm while I drank, because it was so cold out. Mardi Gras that year was in February. I told him to come inside with me and have a drink. While we were drinking I learned that he was a decent guy. I offered him to come home with me and get out of the cold for the night, have something to eat, take a shower, wash his clothes, and in the morning I would drive him back to the park. He used the spare bedroom in my house. My sister was living with me at the time. She thought I was crazy for taking the chance, but it all worked out.</p>
                                <p>My sister was an alcoholic at the time, and did drugs. She would hang out with some questionable women. She told me some of them would prositute themselves to feed their different habits. One day a girl knocked on the door looking for my sister. My sister wasn't home, but I told her if she ever needed a safe place for the night she could come in and eat, shower, clean her clothes, and rest comfortably. She asked me what I wanted in exchange. I told her I didn't want anything, but drug use was not allowed in my house. She left, but came back another night, and took me up on my offer. Soon it got around what I did, and other girls were showing up looking for a safe place. I never accepted sex as payment. Some of the girls would offer me sex, though. I told them they could clean the bathroom, clean the stove, do my laundry, but I wasn't accepting sex. They could get off the street for a night and watch TV with me, that's it. I only wanted the company.</p>
                                <p>When I lived in Florida, I met a girl named Kim. She would always approach me at the grocery store in the parking lot, and beg for money. I would never give her any money. Then one trip to the store she started talking to me. I learned a little bit about her. I offered her an opportunity to come home with me after my shopping was done, and get off the street for a day. She took me up on it. She washed her clothes, ate, showered, and slept in my guest bedroom. I took her back to the parking lot the next day. This happened more and more, and we became friends, and I started caring about her. She ended up moving in. We lived together for roughly a year. Every day she went to the gas station just outside my neighborhood, and begged for money. She earned enough to buy cigarettes and beer. She was a bad drunk, though. She would get drunk and leave for days. I know she was doing drugs when she left. But, I always let her back in. We weren't romantically involved. She was very ugly, and hard to look at. Her years on the street took it's toll. She could tell I was not interested in her sexually, and it bothered her. It hurt her, and she told me so. I couldn't respond to her sexually. When I moved to Georgia, I had to leave her behind.</p>

                                <p></p>Cremate my body and put the ashes in a garbage bag. Then place the garbage bag in a trash can. I want this done because, I AM garbage.

                                <h5 class="mb-1">PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>My father was brutal with his physical punshment. One time when I was 8 we were all camping. I had done something that upset my dad. He was drunk at the time (practically all the time). He grabbed my throat and smacked me around so bad I fell to the ground. Then he started kicking me. The campers next to us ran over. The man put himself between me and my father. The woman bent down to help me, screaming , "Stop! You're killing him." My t-shirt was full of blood and my eye was swollen. The woman took me back to her camp while they waited for the police. The police talked to my dad, and we got kicked out of the camp ground that night, and left the next day. I was afraid to go near my dad after that.</p>
                                <p>Whenever I got into a fight growing up, I would beat the hell out of the other person, the same way my father beat me. I would bang their head against the ground saying "I'll kill you. I'll kill you.", over and over, until I was pulled off the other person. Many times I was in a blackout state.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">FORGOTTEN GOOD TIMES</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>I know not all my childhood was full of tragic experiences, though. There were plenty of good times. My sisters and I went camping with our father every year. We had an Aunt and Uncle that loved us. My Grandmother and Grandfather were very loving. The safest place I ever knew was in their house. My Grandmother excepted me completely for who I am. She didn't always agree with me, but she never turned her back on me. I never had to earn her love. She was my rock when I was a child. Since her death, I have not been able to feel as safe as I did when she was alive.</p>
                                <p>I wish I could concentrate on the good times, but it seems it's the worse moments that I focus on. Especially in the mornings when I first wake up. I hate the world, first thing in the morning. I'm the most critical of myself, and my loved one's. It takes hours before I start to settle down. I don't understand it.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Doctor Adamson, you have made a difference, through listening, understanding, asking questions, giving me your interpretations, and helping me with extra's, like benefits. I've needed someone to hear me, and understand what I've been through. I've kept some of these experiences to myself for so long. I need someone to hear what happened and interpret it for me so I can see it differently, or be able to invalidate the thought without invaliding me. I may have to repeat my stories a few times before I can accept a new way to see them, but I'm now willing to have the conversations. I am unable to just think my way out of it with CBT. I'm subject to the judgment of my conscious. I want to let go of the hurt.</p>
                                <p>Doc, I don't want to quit. I really don't. I just don't know why I shouldn't. Of course, I will go back to work, eventually. I'll get my own place again. I will pay my debts over time. But, the world is nothing but hurtful. I don't want to engage with it anymore. I really can't take much more of this life.</p>
