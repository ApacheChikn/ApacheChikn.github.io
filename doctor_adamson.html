                                <h5 class="mb-1">Good morning, Doctor Adamson.</h5>
                                
                                <p>This was very difficult for me to write. However, I believe it is necessary for me to start the healing process. Please DELETE this document when you have finished our session. I absolutely do not want it in my VA records. YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I HAVE EVER SHARED number 13 with. Please don't jump to number 13. Let's go through the list in order. Number 13 is not the most important topic, that's why it's number 13. I went into detail on number 13 because you must understand why I feel inadequate. The evidence is clear. I don't want to dwell on it, though. My explanation for bringing it up is at the end of number 13. Once we read over it, we can move on. Thank you.</p>
                                <p>Remember, I have NEVER shared these events with another person. I respect you enough that I believe I can trust you with my vulnerabilities. Please respect my request to delete this document. I won't go into any physical description of myself, just a sharing of my stories. I hope you are okay with it. If not, I apologize.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>I have two sisters in AA. They told me step 5 is to confess to another human being. I always said I would never go into a 12-step program or confess to another person, ever. I confess to God only. Well, today I am going to try confessing (telling my story) to another human being some of my most embarrassing and tragic experiences. I wrote it down because I didn't think I could go through with it in our session. I think this is easier for me. Remember, please be discrete with your notes and delete this document. Once we read over this document, we won't ever need to discuss it further.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Please keep in mind that there are other core beliefs I could have addressed. I chose this because four other core beliefs are encompassed in this one. This isn't the only core belief I gave a 5 to.</p>

                                <p>A core belief I want to change: I am inadequate.</p>
                                <p>This one core belief covers these others which I gave a 5 to.</p>
                                    <p>I am unwanted.</p>
                                    <p>I am rejected.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I went to jail and lost the motel room I was staying in for the past 2 years. As soon as the people on whom I rely run out of generosity, I'll be in a shelter.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I am codependent and do whatever someone wants of me, and I believe lies. I know I am being lied to, but I am so glad to have companionship that I put up with it. I put up with things I shouldn't because I am pathetic.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I have failed at life. I'm not worth making a personal investment in. Seriously, who would want to have a relationship with someone who does nothing but fail?</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">People can tell when someone is desperate for friendship or a relationship. It turns them off. They don't want to attempt a friendship or a relationship because they are scared I would be clingy. I've never been clingy. I give people space.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>My mother told me more than once, when I was a child, that I would end up alone.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">I am putting my family and friends in a situation where I have to depend on them. I think they are running out of patience.</p>
                                <br />

                                <p class="mb-2">The next one is the one I needed someone to understand. The one I have never shared with another person. I only brought this up the last time we met because it is evidence for the statement, "I am inadequate."
                                    I know the majority of women do not make penis size a priority, but, with me, they aren't getting what they need in the physical part of a relationship. If you begin reading it and find it uncomfortable or an unacceptable topic, we can skip it.</small></p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">13: I'm physically inadequate/</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2">because I was born without the means to pleasure a woman sexually.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p class="mb-2">I first noticed I was different when I was on the swim team in high school and we had to wear speedos. You couldn't even tell I was a boy down there. I looked like a female in a bikini bottom. I was made fun of for it.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">My very first experience with sexual intercourse was with my girlfriend, Eleanor Morna Palmer. She had already had sex with her former boyfriend, so she was experienced. When we started having sex she said she couldn't even feel me. She asked, "Are you in. I can't feel you." We had sex a couple more times and then she broke up with me. She started gossiping to other female friends of ours that I was so small she didn't even know I was inside her. They would snicker all the time about me.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">Then I left for the Marine Corps boot camp, and during the 16 weeks of training, my girlfriend broke up with me. When I returned home and found out we weren't a couple anymore, I learned she had told everyone about how she put up with my "tiny pencil dick for too long." While in boot camp, we all had to shower together. It was obvious how insignificant I was in that area. I had a chance to see other men naked, and I was completely embarrassed. Some would point and laugh. I would try to turn and hide myself.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">Once I got out of the Marine Corps, I met girls in college. Some of the girls I dated were downright rude. One girl was going to be a one-night stand. We met at a bar. We left and went to my place. We got undressed together. When she saw me naked, she giggled and started getting dressed. I asked her what was wrong. She said she just couldn't go through with it because she couldn't do anything with that, pointing at my penis. I gave her a ride back to her dorm and left feeling humiliated.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">One time, my girlfriend, Gale (she was an identical twin. Her sisters name was Dale), whom I had been dating for roughly three months came to me and asked for an open relationship. I asked why, and she said I was a really nice guy. I gave her everything but satisfaction in bed. She said she was sorry but needed that. I could tell she had a hard time telling me. I believed her and I understood. I told her I wasn't going to have an open relationship. It would be too painful for me to think that someone else is having sex with her. I said she should just break up with me and go her way. She stayed another two weeks until I found out she was cheating on me. I ended the relationship.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">The last two girlfriends I had were black women. They both commented to me at different times that they knew white guys were small, but not that small. I commented that I don't represent all white guys. I ignored them because I was so desperate to have someone in my life.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">The first one was, Cathlean Charmaine Robinson. A beautiful name for a beautiful woman. She had a serious drinking problem, though. We worked together in an Industrial Plant. I walked through the plant always looking at the floor. I felt invisible most of the time. One day Cathlean walked passed me as I was looking down and walking to the break room. I heard, "Hi Shawn" in the sweetest voice. When I looked up her smile melted my heart. I was instantly in love. I looked for her after my break and asked for her phone number. She gave it to me and we talked on the phone a few times before we started meeting after work. She was in a bad situation. She had received two DUI's in one week. She was spending her weekends in jail and she couldn't afford a lawyer. She already served 10 years in prison when she lived in Ohio. So, she was used to doing time. She bounced around from couch to couch like I am doing right now. I offered her an opportunity. I told her I was lonely, and I liked her company. I would help her financially if she would spend time with me. She took my offer and immediately dragged me to the store and started buying herself the clothes she had wanted. Of course, I paid for them. We spent time together enough that I went to kiss her one evening and she backed off. She didn't allow it. I told her I was interested in taking the relationship to another level. She wasn't interested because she wanted her freedom and thought I would be too clingy. But, she did engage in sex with me a few weeks later. We got undressed together and she looked at me like WTF. She said, "I know I'm not going to get anything out of this, but come on let's get it over with." I was embarrassed and felt like a loser. She ended up making excuses for not coming over anymore. She stopped seeing me. A couple of months later she died. She had a heart condition that was made worse by her drinking. She went to sleep one night on a friend's couch and never woke up again.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">The second black woman was Shavonne Elaine Giles. I met Shavonne shortly after she did 8 years in prison. She was a cook at the Waffle House not too far from where I was staying. I would eat there often. We hit it off and started seeing each other pretty quickly. She made me feel wanted. I had been alone for a couple of years by then. It was a couple of months into the relationship before we got into the physical part of the relationship. She was immediately disappointed with me sexually. We ended up shopping for adult toys shortly after our first time together (she insisted). It was all she ever wanted me to use on her from then on. I always felt bad about myself because I couldn't do more for her. Sometimes she didn't even reciprocate sexually. We stayed together for over a year. I think it lasted that long because I was paying her rent, and buying her groceries. I ended up buying a second car so she could drive herself to work instead of paying for rides. The relationship ended shortly after the car purchase. I allowed her to use the car for a few weeks to get herself settled into using public transportation again. She never returned the car.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">My mother commented once by saying, "You'll never get a girlfriend with that" pointing to my penis. I was 10 and wearing one of her wigs, running around naked in the house just being a kid. I never ran around unclothed again.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">Because of these experiences and others, I have no confidence. There were several times that I considered cutting my testicles off to stop testosterone production, which would kill my libido, which would stop me from seeking out physical romantic relationships.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p class="mb-2">Why did I share so many experiences? It is important to understand the evidence. Also, you had a difficult time believing that someone would do such things to another person. They do, and worse. I have other hurtful stories, but you get the point. As you can see, I haven't given up on seeking someone to spend my life with. I know God will provide my Eve. I do believe that someone will love me for who I am. So, that is enough of that topic. I know there is more to a man than his penis size. I don't dwell on it. I really don't emphasize my shortcomings in relationships. Take me as I am, is my attitude. But, at times I do look in the mirror and berate myself.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p class="mb-2">Thank you for letting me get that out of my system. Each one represents a pain that I have to face every time I engage in a physical relationship.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">If I offended you, I am sorry. I will never talk about it again.</p>

                                <p>Here's my problem with telling myself positive thoughts: Why am I supposed to accept compliments as true and insults as false? I'm tired of being told that the negative comments are to be ignored and the compliments are to be accepted (except from you, Doc, your input I accept as truth). Chances are, the negative comments are the truest. Compliments are phony. How can someone who doesn't know me ever give me a genuine compliment? They can't. If I haven't EARNED compliments, then they are not real. They shouldn't just be handed out. You may ask why that doesn't apply to negative comments. People don't have to know someone very well to make a negative comment.</p>

                                <p>When I lived in Mobile, Alabama, I went to Mardi Gras every year. One year all my friends called it a night and went home. I drove one friend home then went back to the party in downtown Mobile. I pulled up in front of a bar and parked my car. A homeless man staying in the park across the street approached me. I told him I didn't have any money because I was using a debit card. He said he didn't want money. He asked if he could sit in my car to stay warm while I drank, because it was so cold out. Mardi Gras that year was in February. I told him to come inside with me and have a drink. While we were drinking I learned that he was a decent guy. I offered him to come home with me and get out of the cold for the night, have something to eat, take a shower, wash his clothes, and in the morning I would drive him back to the park. He used the spare bedroom in my house. My sister was living with me at the time. She thought I was crazy for taking the chance. It all worked out.</p>

                                <p>My sister was an alcoholic at the time. She would hang out with some questionable women. She told me some of them would prositute themselves to feed their different habits. One day a girl knocked on the door looking for my sister. She wasn't home, but I told her if she ever needed a safe place for the night she could come in and eat, shower, clean her clothes, and rest comfortably. She asked me what I wanted in exchange. I told her I didn't want anything, but drug use was not allowed in my house. She left but came back another night and took me up on my offer. My sister didn't mind. Soon it got around what I did and other girls were showing up looking for a safe place. I never accepted sex as payment. Some of the girls would offer me sex. I told them they could clean the bathroom, clean the stove, do my laundry, but I wasn't accepting sex. They could get off the street for a night and watch TV with me. I wanted the company only.</p>

                                <p>When I lived in Florida I met a girl named, Kim. She would always approach me at the grocery store in the parking lot. She was begging for money. I would never give her any money. Then one trip to the store she started talking to me and I talked to her in return. I learned a little bit about her. I offered her an opportunity to come home with me after my shopping was done and get off the street for a day. She took me up on it. She washed her clothes, ate, showered, and slept in my guest bedroom. I took her back to the parking lot the next day. This happened more and more until she ended up moving in. We became friends and I started caring for her. We lived together for roughly a year. We would stand in food bank lines together because that was the one thing she could contribute. She also cooked food and did my laundry. She kept the house clean, too. Every day she went to the gas station just outside my neighborhood and begged for money. She earned enough to buy cigarettes and beer. She was a bad drunk. She would get drunk and leave for days. But, I always let her back in. We weren't romantically involved. She was extremely ugly and hard to look at. She was physically repulsive. She could tell I was not interested in her sexually and it bothered her. It hurt her and she told me so. I know how she felt because I experienced similar rejections, but I couldn't respond to her sexually. When I moved to Georgia I had to leave her behind.</p>

                                <p>My father was brutal with his physical punshments on me. One time when I was 8 we were all camping. I had done something that upset my dad. He was drunk at the time (practically all the time). He smacked me around so bad I fell to the ground. Then he started kicking me. I curled up in a ball and he kicked me even harder. The campers next to us ran over. The man put himself between me and my father. The woman bent down to help me, screaming , "Stop, you're killing him." My t-shirt was full of blood. The woman took me back to her camp while they waited for the police. The police talked to my dad and we got kicked out of the camp ground the next day. I was afraid to go near my dad after that.</p>

                                <p>Not all my childhood was full of tragedy, though. There were plenty of good times. My sisters and I went camping with our father every year. We had an Aunt and Uncle that loved us. My Grandmother and Grandfather were angels. The safest place I ever knew was their house. My Grandmother excepted me completely for who I am. She didn't always agree with me, but she never turned her back on me. I never had to earn her love. She was my rock when I was a child. Since her death, I have not been able to feel as safe as I did when she was alive.</p>
                                <p>I wish I could concentrate on the good times, but it seems the worse moments of my youth are all I can focus on. Especially in the mornings when I first wake up. I hate the world, first thing in the morning.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Doctor Adamson, you have made an impact on my life. I need someone to hear me and understand what I've been through. I've kept some of these experiences to myself for so long. I need someone to hear what happened and interpret it for me so I can see it differently. I may have to repeat my stories a few times before I can accept a new way to see them, but I'm willing to have the conversations. I am unable to just think my way out of it with CBT. I want to let go of the hurt. By talking to you, I believe I will be able to start letting them go. You're able to see past the hurt I experienced and interpret things with an unbiased point of view. With a clinical diagnosis.</p>

                                <p>Doc, I don't want to quit. I really don't. I just don't know why I shouldn't. Of course, I will go back to work, eventually. I'll get my own place again. I will pay my debts over time. But, the world is nothing but hurtful. I don't want to engage with it anymore. I really can't take much more of this life.</p>
