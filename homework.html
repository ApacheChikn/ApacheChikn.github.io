                                <h5 class="mb-1">Good morning, Doctor Adamson.</h5>
                                <p>Doing this homework, and writing down my thoughts and experiences, wasn't easy for me. I find myself waking up everyday with thoughts like these, and ruminating over past experiences like these. They aren't the only ones, though.</p>
                                <p>YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I HAVE EVER SHARED SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES WITH. I wrote them down, because I didn't think I could go through with telling them in our session.</p>
                                <p>It will take a few minutes to read. We can start our session late, or end it early, so you can get back your time.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="position-relative mb-4">

                                <h5 class="mb-1"></h5>
                                <p>When I was in High School, my friend Clay, had a deformity. He was born without a right arm, and at the right shoulder, he had 3 little fingers he could wiggle. He was made fun of a lot; mostly behind his back. Also, he had a hard time getting a girlfriend, because of his deformity. Sometimes, he wore a fake arm to fit in, and people would intentionally bump into it and laugh. Doctor, if you were to have a therapy session with him, I figure you wouldn't concentrate on his deformity, but you would focus on his hurtful experiences. That is what I am hoping for, after you read number 13.</p>

I brought this up the last time we met, but here I am going to provide an explanation, and more evidence for the core belief, "I am inadequate." This includes my anatomical deformity. I only mentioned two painful incidences last time we met. Here are the others. I have NEVER shared these with another person, EVER. It seemed to me that you had a hard time believing that things like this happen. It seemed to me that you had a difficult time believing that penis size was important to some women. I knew guys who were turned down by women because their penis was too big. It is as important to some women, the same way breast size is important to some men. The way a man's height is important to some women. The way obese people, of both sexes, are rejected, because most people prefer a healthier person. Everyone has a preferrence. My deformity isn't on anyone's list of preferrences, though.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">13: I'm physically inadequate/</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2">because I was born stunted and puny.</p>
                                <p>I was born with a deformity called micro penis, due to my mother having hormone issues during her pregnancy with me. And, the lower ring of my inguinal canal, on the right side of my abdomen, did not close off. The spermatic cord attached to the right testicle didn't develop properly. At times, this causes my right testicle to rise up, through the inguinal canal, and stay in my abdomen, which can look like I don't have testicles.</p>
                                <p>If I find the courage to have the conversation with a woman about my situation, I suffer tremendous anxiety, and I am embarrassed, regardless. I'm always prepared to be rejected, because I have been, numerous times.</p>

A couple times she said to me, -You'll never get a girlfriend with that,- pointing to my penis. One time when I was 10, I was wearing one of her wigs and her shoes, walking around naked in the house. She took a polariod of me. When her friends came over she would show them the photo. The comments I heard always made me cry, even though I didn't quite understand why it mattered. All I knew is they were laughing at me. I never ran around naked again. <br><br>When I was on the swim team in high school we had to wear speedos. You couldn't tell I was a boy. I looked like a woman wearing just a bikini bottom. I was on the swim team for three years, and some guys often made fun of me. I didn't return my senior year, because I had enough of it. <br><br>My first sexual experience was with, Eleanor Morna Palmer. She already had sex with a couple boyfriends, but I was a virgin. She wanted to take my virginity. She made me feel so stupid for trusting her, though. Our first, and only time together, she kept saying, -I can't feel you. Are you inside me?- She was trying to make me feel bad. She was intentionally cruel. She let everyone know my penis was too small to feel. <br><br>Then I left for the Marine Corps boot camp, and during the 16 weeks of training, my girlfriend, Kelly, broke up with me. When I returned home and found out we weren't a couple anymore, I learned she had told everyone how she put up with my -tiny dick for too long.- <br><br>While in boot camp, we all had to shower together. I had a chance to see other men naked, and I immediately knew, just how deficient I was. Some of the guys would point and laugh. I would try to turn and hide myself. <br><br>When I was on the U.S.S. Saipan, during a Mediterranean Float, another Marine had been in the head showering at the same time as me. He came up to me to pass by, when I was drying myself off. I stood up to let him go past me, but he grabbed my penis and balls, and said, -Ain't that so cute-. I just froze, like I did in the foster home. I went back into the shower stall, and had a heart attack. It turned out he was gay, and was caught having sex with other Marines and Sailors in the Fan Room. They were all taken off the ship. <br><br>Once I got out of the Marine Corps, I met girls in college. <br><br>I met a girl one night at a bar, and we hit it off. We got drunk, then went to my apartment for casual sex. We got undressed together, and when she saw me naked, she giggled and started getting dressed. I asked her what was wrong. She said, -I can't go through with it. I can't do anything with that,- pointing at my penis. I gave her a ride back to her dorm and left feeling humiliated. <br><br>I had a girlfriend, Amye Lee Strange, whom I fell in love with. She and I dated for over a year. One day my insecurity got the better of me, and I asked if she was satisfied with our sex life. She said it was okay, but she missed feeling a man inside her. It hurt so bad to hear that. I was devastated. I imagine it is how all women feel when they have sex with me. <br><br>After college I was seeing a girl, Leslie Rene Hagler. We would get drunk and fool around. We went to a party at her friends house, which was a three hours drive from Mobile. We spent the night, because of the distance. I got drunk, went to bed, and passed out. Leslie pulled the sheets off me, then slipped my underwear off, while I was unconscious. She played some really loud music in the room and woke me up. She was with two of her girlfriends, standing next to the bed looking at me, and laughing. I heard Leslie say, -See, I told you he don't have a dick.- The ride home was awkward. She kept apologizing and blaming it on being drunk. <br><br>My girlfriend, Gale, whom I had been dating for roughly three months, came to me and asked for an open relationship. She wanted to go with another guy we both knew, and told me I could go with other women. I asked why she would want that. She said, -You're a really nice guy, Shawn. You give me everything, except in bed, and I need that.- I told her I wasn't going to have an open relationship. It would be too painful for me to think about her having sex with someone else. I told her to break up with me and go her way. She stayed another two weeks, until I found out she was cheating on me. <br><br>When I lived in Florida, I went to the VA Clinic for a rash on my left groin. The nurse came in to look at it, and brought another nurse into the room with her. The rule was that a female nurse couldn't be in a room with a male patient, without another nurse there to witness. I had to lower my pants for her to see the rash. When I dropped my underwear to show her the rash they both started to giggle. The witness nurse covered her mouth, and turned around, because she couldn't wipe the smile off her face. <br><br>Cathlean Charmaine Robinson, was a black woman I worked with. We talked on the phone a few times, before we started meeting after work. She was in a bad situation. She had a serious drinking problem. She had received two DUI's in one week. She was spending her weekends in jail, and she couldn't afford a lawyer. I offered her an opportunity. I told her I was lonely, and I liked her company. I would help her financially, if she would spend more time with me. She accepted my offer. We spent enough time together that I developed feelings for her. One night I went to kiss her, and she jumped back shocked. I told her I was interested in having a physical relationship. She didn't want that with me, because she thought I would be clingy. A few weeks later, we got drunk and had sex. When we got undressed she looked at me like -WTF-. She said, -I know I'm not going to get anything out of this. Let's get it over with.- I was embarrassed and felt like a loser. She ended up making excuses for not coming over anymore. <br><br>My last girlfriend, Shavonne Elaine Giles, was more than three years ago. She was a black woman. She was a cook at the Waffle House, where I would eat often, not too far from where I was staying. We hit it off and started seeing each. It was a couple of months into the relationship before we tried to have sex. She was disappointed with it, and let me know. She commented to me that -She knew white guys were small, but not that small.- I ignored the comment because I was so desperate to have someone in my life. We went shopping for adult toys shortly after our first time together; she insisted. The size of the toys she would pick out made me feel ashamed. It was all she ever wanted me to use on her, from then on. I always felt bad about myself, because I couldn't satisfy her traditionally. Sometimes she didn't even reciprocate sexually. We stayed together for over a year. I think it lasted that long because I was paying her rent, and buying her groceries. I ended up buying a second car, so she could drive herself to work, instead of paying for rides. The relationship ended shortly after the car purchase. I allowed her to use the car for a few weeks to get herself settled into using public transportation. She never returned the car. <br><br>These experiences weren't simply hurtful. Some of the women intentionally caused me pain and shame. I was crushed every time. I'm not a man with an average sized penis and a self-image issue. I have a deformity. <br><br>There were several times in my life that I considered cutting off my testicles, which I though would kill my libido, which would stop me from seeking out physical relationships. Several times I even tied rubberbands around them, to make them hurt, because I hated them. I would stand in front of the mirror naked and tell myself -You're a fucking loser. Give it up.- -No one wants you. Just kill yourself.- I used to take stick matches, light the head of the match, blow it out, then stick it into my penis. I did that to scar myself, and keep myself from trying anymore. <br><br>Doctor, I think you said, -Feelings aren't based on facts.- It's these facts that my feelings are based on. It's these facts that are behind the negative thoughts I have. I was mortified every time, and my self-esteem was destroyed. I AM inadequate, in more than one way. I always have been. My whole life I have been. It's not just my crotch. It's the whole list of inadequacies. I can hide my deformity in a pair of pants. But, I can't hide the other stuff in this list. I'm a fucking loser. I'm not going to bullshit myself. <br><br>I remember you had a difficult time believing that someone would do such things to another person. They do, and worse. I hate myself for being a piece of shit. <br><br>I hope I was clear, and respectful of you. I wasn't upset with your comments. I don't want to focus on my penis. I need to get these memories out of my head. It's the memory behind the thought that's my problem. I explained my deformity, so you would understand the reactions I received. No one is listening to what caused the thought. <br><br>Thank you for understanding. If I offended you, I am sorry. I just want someone to understand why I am, where I am. Please keep in mind, number 13 is not the only thing that bothers me. The rest of the list bothers me just as much. <br><br><br>When you get to number 14, scroll back up to the BUTTON you clicked to make this text disappear.";

                                <h5 class="mb-1">LONELINESS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Most of my life I have felt loneliness. If I had to guess when I first felt loneliness, I would say when I was removed from my home and put in a group home. I was separated from my mother and 3 sisters. I was 4 years old. I wasn't in the group home long before a foster family took me in. I spent a short period of time in the first home, before I was placed in another home, where my sisters were. Apparently, it wasn't easy to find a foster family that would take 4 children at once. My youngest sister was around 6 months old. We spent 2 years with the foster family. Really bad things happened there.</p>
                                <p>The foster family consisted of Martha, Eddy, and Eddy Jr. Then there was us four. And, from time to time, at least one or two other kids would cycle through for a couple days, up to a week. One of the kids that came through, molested me. I was four and he was twelve. He liked to watch wrestling on tv, then act like he was a wrestler. Several times he pinned me down on my stomach with my arms back between his knees, so I couldn't move. Then he would lay on my back enough to pull my underwear down. He would rub his penis into my butt cheeks. Sometimes he would penetrate my anus. He would always ejaculate on my butt cheeks before he got off of me, telling me I better not tell. I stayed frozen until he left, but eventually I would pull up my underwear and feel this sticky stuff on my butt. I thought he had spit on me, until I was older, and truly understood what he did. He was also molesting Eddy, Jr. He was sticking his penis in Eddy's mouth, and Martha caught them. She had him removed from the home. I was always angry with my parents for putting me there, and leaving me.</p>
                                <p>Every time I returned home from a deployment, while in the Marine Corps, I felt loneliness. Not one time was anyone waiting for me to return. It always hurt me to be alone at those homecomings. I was so envious of the guys who had people waiting for them. I knew I wasn't worth anyone's time. I was happy for them, though.</p>
                                <p>I have felt loneliness most of my life. It causes me physical pain in my chest. If I were to shoot myself, it would be in the heart, because that's where I hurt the most. Loneliness causes me to cry often, so I find a place that's private and cry, while telling myself I'm worthless and stupid. That's because I am.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">ROTTING</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I was 9, my mother started neglecting me; differently than usual. She stopped taking care of me. I didn't get showers, and I didn't wear clean clothes. I started to smell bad. It went on so long that the skin on my feet started to rot, and shed off, my hair started falling out, and I developed a very large and itchy rash on the inside of my left groin. My father came to pick us up for our summer camping trip. He smelt me and ask why I stink. My oldest sister told him, "Mom doesn't care anymore about Shawn." When he confronted my mother, she told him, "He's your son. You take care of him." My father took me to a doctor after the vacation. I had to take time off from school to clear up. I ended up having to rub a lotion on my head, and wear a shower cap to stop my hair from falling out any further. I couldn't wear shoes for awhile, and had to rub a cream on them, then wear socks only. I got a shot, and had to put calamine lotion on the rash, until it went away; which took a very long time. I was constantly scratching it and making it bleed. When I went to therapy back in 1995, the therapist told me that I represented my father to my mother. She treated me poorly to get back at him.</p>
                                <p>One time I was expelled from school for a week, because I got into a fight on the playground, and cussed out the teacher. I was only in the first grade. When I got home, my mother sat me in a chair in the middle of my room. I had to sit upright. She tied my legs and arms to the chair. I was crying and begging her to let me out. She put duct tape over my mouth, so she wouldn't have to hear me crying. She left me that way for hours. She did this often as a punishment.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>My father was brutal with his physical punishment. One time when I was 8 we were all camping. I had thrown trash into our camp fire, and that upset my dad. He was drunk at the time (practically all the time). He grabbed my throat and smacked me around so bad I fell to the ground. Then he started kicking me. The campers next to us ran over. The woman bent down to help me, screaming, "Stop! You're killing him." The man put himself between me and my father. My t-shirt was full of blood. The woman took me back to her camp while they waited for the park rangers. The park rangers talked to my dad, and told him to leave the next day. I was afraid to go near my dad after that.</p>
                                <p>Whenever I got into a fight growing up, I would beat the hell out of the other kid, the same way my father beat me that day. I would bang their head against the ground yelling, "I'll kill you. I'll kill you.", over and over, until I was pulled off the other person. Most of the time I blacked out. My friends had to tell me what I did.</p>

                                <span class="bi bi-arrow-right fs-4 text-light position-absolute" style="top: -5px; left: -50px;"></span>
                                <h5 class="mb-1">TAKING RISKS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I lived in Mobile, Alabama, I went to Mardi Gras every year. One year, all my friends called it a night and went home. I drove a friend home, then went back to the party, in downtown Mobile. I pulled up in front of a bar, and parked my car. A homeless man staying in the park across the street approached me. He asked if he could sit in my car to stay warm while I was in the bar, because it was so cold out. I told him to come inside with me and have a drink. While we were drinking I learned that he was a decent guy. I offered him to come home with me and get out of the cold for the night, have something to eat, take a shower, wash his clothes, and in the morning I would drive him back to the park. He used the spare bedroom in my house. My sister was living with me at the time. She thought I was crazy, but it all worked out.</p>
                                <p>My oldest sister, who was living with me, was an alcoholic, and did drugs. She would hang out with some questionable women. She told me some of them would prositute themselves, because they had drug habits. One day a girl knocked on the door looking for my sister. My sister wasn't home, but I told the girl if she ever needed a safe place for the night she could come in and eat, shower, clean her clothes, and rest. I told her my sister and I would make sure nothing happened to her. She asked me what I wanted. I told her I didn't want anything, but drug use was not allowed in my house. She left, but came back another night, and took me up on my offer. Soon it got around what I did, and other girls started showing up looking for a safe place. I never accepted sex as payment. Some of the girls would offer me sex, though. I told them they could clean the bathroom, clean the stove, do my laundry, but I wasn't accepting sex. I told them they could get off the street for a night and watch TV with me, that's it. I was lonely and wanted the company.</p>
                                <p>When I lived in Florida, I met a girl named Kim. She would always approach me at the grocery store in the parking lot, and beg for money. I would never give her any money. Then one trip to the store she started talking to me. I learned a little bit about her. I offered her an opportunity to come home with me after my shopping was done, and get off the street for a day. She took me up on it. She washed her clothes, ate, showered, and slept in my guest bedroom. I took her back to the parking lot the next day. This happened more and more, and we became friends, and I started trusting her, and caring about her. She ended up moving in. We lived together for roughly a year. Every day she went to the gas station just outside my neighborhood, and begged for money. She earned enough to buy cigarettes and beer. She was a bad drunk, though. She would get drunk and leave for days. I knew she was doing drugs when she left. But, I always let her back in. We weren't romantically involved; I didn't want that. I knew she prostituted herself to get her drugs. When I moved to Georgia, I had to leave her behind.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">POSITIVE vs. NEGATIVE</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Here's my problem with accepting compliments. Why am I supposed to accept compliments as true, and insults as false? I'm told that the negative comments are to be ignored, and the compliments are to be accepted. The negative comments are the truest. Compliments are phony. How can someone who doesn't know me ever give me a genuine compliment? They can't. If I haven't EARNED compliments, then they are not real. They shouldn't just be handed out. You may ask why that doesn't apply to negative comments. People don't have to know someone very well to make a negative comment. The evidence is how the world responds to me. So, trying to tell myself something that goes against the evidence is useless. It is better to accept the truth, and then I can stop the struggle of opposing thoughts. Acceptance is the way out.</p>

                                <p>Not all my childhood was full of tragic experiences. We had an Aunt and Uncle that loved us. My Grandmother and Grandfather were very loving. The safest place I ever knew was in their house. My Grandmother always loved to see us. She was my rock when I was a child. Since her death, I have not felt loved, or as safe, as I did when she was alive.</p>
                                <p>I wish I could concentrate on the good times, but it's the worse moments that consume my thoughts. Especially, in the mornings when I first wake up. I hate the world, first thing in the morning. I hate myself, as soon as my eyes open. I'm the most critical of myself, and my loved one's then. It takes hours before I start to settle down. I don't understand it.</p>

                                <p>I had <b>28</b> "Unhealthy Core Beliefs" to choose from. Without deliberate intention, I chose "I am inadequate."</P><P>From day one with the VA Health Care, I have been lying by omission. Everything I have ever shared is the truth. But, I left out some of the conversations I want to have, because I had been turned away for less. I attempted to get help two different times, through Veteran Service Officers, who turned me away because I didn't have "service connected" problems. Even though, I told them I was abusing alcohol and drugs, and needed help. The third time I went to a VA Clinic, I was arrested. Because of those experiences, I kept certain things to myself, to keep from being kicked out. Also, I couldn't talk about everything that happened, so I didn't. I've kept some of these experiences to myself for so long. I want someone to hear what happened, and help me. I need someone to listen.</p>
