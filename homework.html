                                <p>Doing this homework, writing down these experiences and thoughts, wasn't easy for me. But, I find myself waking up everyday with thoughts like these in my head. YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I HAVE EVER SHARED MOST OF THEM WITH.</p>
                                <p>This will take a few minutes to read. It took me 20 minutes. We can end the meeting early, so you can get back your time.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>I have two sisters in AA. They both told me step 5 is to confess to another human being. I always said I would never go into a 12-step program, or confess to another person, ever. I confess to God, only. Well, today I am going to try confessing (telling my story) to another human being, some of my most embarrassing and tragic experiences. I wrote it down, because I didn't think I could go through with it in our session.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Please keep in mind there are other core beliefs I could have addressed. I chose this one because four other core beliefs are encompassed in it. This isn't the only core belief I gave a 5 to. Let's get started.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>A core belief I want to change: I AM INADEQUATE.</p>
                                <p>This one core belief covers these other core beliefs, which I gave a 5 to.</p>
                                    <p>I am unwanted.</p>
                                    <p>I am rejected.</p>
                                    <p>I am undesirable.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I went to jail and lost the motel room I was staying in. As soon as the people on whom I rely run out of generosity, I'll be in a shelter.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">because I have failed at life. I'm not worth making a personal investment in. Seriously, who would want to have a relationship with someone who does nothing but fail?</p>

                                <p>My mother told me more than once, when I was a child, "You will end up alone. You're going to be a hermit".</p>

I brought this up the last time we met, but here I am going to provide more evidence for the statement, "I am inadequate." I only mentioned two occurences last time, purposely. This time I will share others. I have NEVER shared this with another human, EVER. It seemed to me that you had a hard time believing that things like this occurred to me. The ones I shared last time weren't the only ones. Everything in this list happened. Everything. If you begin reading it and you find it inappropriate, or an uncomfortable topic, you can skip it. If you think we discussed it enough last time to understand why I say the things I say about myself, go ahead and skip clicking the button. If you do click the button, click it twice. When you are done reading it, scroll back up and click it again. The list will close again. I will explain, when we meet, why I am telling you this.</small></p>

One time she said to me, -You'll never get a girlfriend with that-, pointing to my penis. Another time when I was 10, I was wearing one of her wigs, running around naked in the house, just being a kid. She took a polariod of me, then showed her friends when they came over. The comments I heard always made me cry, even though I didn't quite understand why it mattered. They were laughing at me, and that hurt. I never ran around unclothed again. <br><br>When I was on the swim team in high school we had to wear speedos. You couldn't tell I was a boy. I looked like a female with a bikini bottom on. I was on the swim team for three years, and was often made fun of. I didn't return my senior year because of the ridiculing. I had enough of it. <br><br>My first sexual experience was with my girlfriend, Eleanor Morna Palmer. She already had sex with her last boyfriend, so she had some experience. When we had sex, she said, -I can't feel you. Are you inside me, yet?- We had sex one more time, then she broke up with me. She let everyone know it was because my penis was too small to feel. <br><br>Then I left for the Marine Corps boot camp, and during the 16 weeks of training, my new girlfriend, Kelly, broke up with me. When I returned home and found out we weren't a couple anymore, I learned she had told everyone about how she put up with my -tiny dick for too long-. <br><br>While in boot camp, we all had to shower together. It was confirmation for me just how insignificant I was in the crotch. I had a chance to see other men naked, and I immediately knew, just how deficient I was. Some of the guys would point and laugh. I would try to turn and hide myself. <br><br>When I was on the U.S.S. Iwo Jima doing a Mediterranean Float, another Marine had been watching me when I was showering. He came up to me when I was drying myself off. I stood up to let him go past me, but he grabbed my penis and balls, and said, -Ain't that so cute-. I just froze, like I was back in the foster home. I was so embarrassed that he made a comment like my exgirlfriends had. He was gay, and got caught having sex with a sailor in the Fan Room. They were both taken off the ship and discarged. <br><br>Once I got out of the Marine Corps, I met girls in college. A couple girls I dated were downright crude. <br><br>I was about to have casual sex one night with a girl I met at a bar. We left and went to my apartment. We got undressed together. When she saw me naked, she giggled and started getting dressed. I asked her what was wrong. She said, -I can't go through with it. I can't do anything with that-, pointing at my penis. I gave her a ride back to her dorm and left feeling humiliated. <br><br>Another girl I was seeing in college, Leslie Hagler, took me to a party at her friends house, which was a three hours drive from Mobile. We were going to spend the night, because of the distance. I had gotten drunk, went to bed, and passed out. Leslie pulled the sheets off me, then slipped my underwear off, while I was unconscious. She played loud music to wake me up, and there she was with two of her girlfriends, standing next to the bed looking at me, and laughing. I heard Leslie say, -See, I told you he's got nothing.- <br><br>After college my girlfriend, Gale, whom I had been dating for roughly three months, came to me and asked for an open relationship. She wanted to go with another guy she knew. I asked why she would want that. She said I was a really nice guy. I gave her everything, except sexual pleasure. She apologized, but said she needed it. I told her I wasn't going to have an open relationship. It would be too painful for me to think about her having sex with someone else. I said she should just break up with me and go her way. She stayed another two weeks, until I found out she was cheating on me. I ended the relationship. <br><br>When I lived in Florida, I went to the VA for a rash on my groin. The nurse came in to look at it, and brought another nurse into the room with her. The rule was that a female nurse couldn't be in a room with a male patient, without another nurse there to witness. I had to lower my pants for her to see the rash. When I dropped my underwear to show her the rash they both started to giggle. The witness nurse had to turn around because she couldn't wipe the smile off her face. They ended up apologizing before they left the room. <br><br>The last two girlfriends I had were black women. They both commented to me that -They knew white guys were small, but not that small-. I ignored the comment because I was so desperate to have someone in my life. <br><br>The first one was, Cathlean Charmaine Robinson. We worked together. One day Cathlean was walking past me as I was looking down and walking to the break room. I heard, -Hi Shawn- in the sweetest voice. When I looked up, her smile melted my heart. I looked for her after my break, and asked for her phone number. She gave it to me, and we talked on the phone a few times, before we started meeting after work. She was in a bad situation. She had a serious drinking problem. She had received two DUI's in one week. She was spending her weekends in jail, and she couldn't afford a lawyer. I offered her an opportunity. I told her I was lonely, and I liked her  company. I would help her financially if she would spend more time with me. She accepted my offer. We spent enough time together that I developed feelings for her. One night I went to kiss her, and she jumped back shocked. I told her I was interested in having a physical relationship. She didn't want that with me, because she thought I would become clingy. But, we did have sex a few weeks later. We got undressed and she looked at me like -WTF-. She said, -I know I'm not going to get anything out of this. Come on, let's get it over with.- I was embarrassed and felt like a loser. She ended up making excuses for not coming over anymore. She stopped seeing me. <br><br>The second black woman was Shavonne Elaine Giles. She was a cook at the Waffle House not too far from where I was staying. I would eat there often. We hit it off and started seeing each. She made me feel wanted. I had been alone for a few years by then. It was a couple of months into the relationship before we got into the physical stuff. She was immediately disappointed with me sexually, and let me know. We ended up shopping for adult toys shortly after our first time together, because she insisted. The size of the toys she would pick out made me feel like shit. It was all she ever wanted me to use on her from then on. I always felt bad about myself because I couldn't satisfy her. Sometimes she didn't even reciprocate sexually. We stayed together for over a year. I think it lasted that long because I was paying her rent, and buying her groceries. I ended up buying a second car, so she could drive herself to work, instead of paying for rides. The relationship ended shortly after the car purchase. I allowed her to use the car for a few weeks to get herself settled into using public transportation. She never returned the car. <br><br>These experiences weren't simply hurtful remarks said out of spite to hurt me. I have been destroyed. <br><br>There were several times in my life that I considered cutting off my testicles, which I though would kill my libido, which would stop me from seeking out physical relationships. Several times I even tied string around them to make them hurt, because I hate myself. I would stand in front of a mirror and tell myself -You're a fucking loser. Give it up.- -No one wants you. Kill yourself already-. <br><br>I think you said, -Feelings aren't based on facts.- Doctor, these are facts. My feelings were hurt. It's important to understand evidence is fact. I am inadequate. I always have been. My whole life I have been. It's not just my crotch. It's the whole list of inadequacies. I can hide my deformity in a pair of pants. But, I can't hide the other stuff in this list. I'm a fucking loser. I don't want to bullshit myself. <br><br>I remember you had a difficult time believing that someone would do such things to another person. They do, and worse. I don't sit around hating on the women who hurt me. I hate on myself for being a piece of shit. <br><br>I hope I was clear, and respectful of you. I wasn't upset with your comment. I'm disappointed that we focus on CBT. No one is listening to what caused the thought. <br><br>Thank you for understanding. If I offended you, I am sorry. I need someone to understand why I am, where I am. Please keep in mind, number 13 is not the only thing that bothers me. The rest of the list bothers me too. <br><br><br>When you get to number 14, scroll back up to the BUTTON you clicked to make this text disappear.";

                                <p>Here's my problem with telling myself positive thoughts. Why am I supposed to accept compliments as true, and insults as false? I'm tired of being told that the negative comments are to be ignored, and the compliments are to be accepted (except from you, Doctor. Your input I accept as truth). Chances are, the negative comments are the truest. Compliments are phony. How can someone who doesn't know me ever give me a genuine compliment? They can't. If I haven't EARNED compliments, then they are not real. They shouldn't just be handed out. You may ask why that doesn't apply to negative comments. People don't have to know someone very well to make a negative comment.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">LONELINESS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Most of my life I have felt loneliness. If I had to guess when I first felt loneliness, I would say when I was removed from my home and put in a group home. I was separated from my mother and 3 sisters. I was 4 years old. I wasn't in the group home long before a foster family took me in. I spent a short period of time in the first home, before I was placed in another home, where my sisters were. Apparently, it wasn't easy to find a foster family that would take 4 children at once. My youngest sister was around 6 months old. We spent 2 years with the foster family. Really bad things happened there.</p>
                                <p>The foster family consisted of Martha, Eddy and Eddy Jr. Then there was us four. And, from time to time at least one or two other kids would cycle through for a day, up to a week. One of the kids that came through, molested me. I was four and he was twelve. He liked to watch wrestling on tv, then act like he was a wrestler. Several times he pinned me down on my stomach with my arms back between his knees, so I couldn't move. Then he would lay on my back enough to pull my underwear down. He would rub his penis into my butt cheeks. Sometimes he would penetrate my anus. He would always ejaculate on my butt cheeks before he got off of me, telling me I better not say anything. I stayed frozen until he left, but eventually I would pull up my underwear and feel this sticky stuff on my ass. I thought he had spit on me, until I was older and truly understood what he did. He was caught molesting me by Martha and she had him removed from the home. After he left it came to light that he had also been molesting Eddy Jr. (by sticking his penis in Eddy's mouth) and my oldest sister (who didn't tell me until we were in our 30's). I was always angry with my parents for putting me in that situation, and then abandoning me.</p>
                                <p>Every time I returned home from a deployment while in the Marine Corps, I felt loneliness. Not one time was anyone waiting for me to return. It always hurt being alone.</p>
                                <p>I have felt loneliness for most of my life, consistently every day. It causes me pain equivalent to a heart attack. It causes me to cry, so I find a place that's private and cry, while telling myself I'm worthless and stupid. That's because I am.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I was 9, my mother stopped taking care of me. She let me stop showering, and I didn't change my clothes. I started smelling bad. It went on so long that the skin on my feet started to rot, and shed off, my hair started falling out, and I developed a very large and itchy wart on the inside of my left groin. My father came to pick us up for our summer camping trip. He smelt me and ask why I stink. My oldest sister told him that mom didn't make me shower anymore. When he confronted my mother, she told him, "He's your son. You take care of him." My father took me to a doctor after the vacation. I had to take time off from school to clear up. I ended up having to rub a lotion on my head, and wear a shower cap to stop my hair from falling out any further. I couldn't wear shoes for awhile, and had to rub a cream on them, then wear socks only. I had to put calamine lotion on the wart until it went away, which took a very long time. I was constantly scratching it and making it bleed. When I went to therapy back in 1995, the therapist told me that I represented my father to my mother. She treated me poorly to get back at my father.</p>
                                <p>One time I was expelled from school for a week, because I got into a fight on the playground. I also was cussing the teacher out. I was only in the first grade. When I got home, my mother sat me in a chair in the middle of my room. I had to sit upright. She tied my legs and arms to the chair. I was crying and begging her to let me out. She put duct tape over my mouth, so she wouldn't have to hear my cries anymore. I endured that punishment 3 other times.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Some people rise above their circumstances and make great lives for themselves. Not me. I end up hating myself and crying in private, because I'm weak. Growing up I was taken care of like the family dog. I had shelter, food, and clothing. Nothing was ever expected of me. I was told to move out after I graduated from high school. I wasn't encouraged to do anything or become anything. I didn't let anyone down.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">TAKING RISKS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I lived in Mobile, Alabama, I went to Mardi Gras every year. One year, all my friends called it a night and went home. I drove a friend home, then went back to the party, in downtown Mobile. I pulled up in front of a bar, and parked my car. A homeless man staying in the park across the street approached me. He asked if he could sit in my car to stay warm while I was in the bar, because it was so cold out. Mardi Gras that year was in February. I told him to come inside with me and have a drink. While we were drinking I learned that he was a decent guy. I offered him to come home with me and get out of the cold for the night, have something to eat, take a shower, wash his clothes, and in the morning I would drive him back to the park. He used the spare bedroom in my house. My sister was living with me at the time. She thought I was crazy, but it all worked out.</p>
                                <p>My oldest sister was an alcoholic at the time, and did drugs. She would hang out with some questionable women. She told me some of them would prositute themselves, because they had drug habits. One day a girl knocked on the door looking for my sister. My sister wasn't home, but I told the girl if she ever needed a safe place for the night she could come in and eat, shower, clean her clothes, and rest. I told her my sister and I would make sure nothing happened to her. She asked me what I wanted. I told her I didn't want anything, but drug use was not allowed in my house. She left, but came back another night, and took me up on my offer. Soon it got around what I did, and other girls started showing up looking for a safe place. I never accepted sex as payment. Some of the girls would offer me sex, though. I told them they could clean the bathroom, clean the stove, do my laundry, but I wasn't accepting sex. I told them they could get off the street for a night and watch TV with me, that's it. I only wanted the company.</p>
                                <p>When I lived in Florida, I met a girl named Kim. She would always approach me at the grocery store in the parking lot, and beg for money. I would never give her any money. Then one trip to the store she started talking to me. I learned a little bit about her. I offered her an opportunity to come home with me after my shopping was done, and get off the street for a day. She took me up on it. She washed her clothes, ate, showered, and slept in my guest bedroom. I took her back to the parking lot the next day. This happened more and more, and we became friends, and I started trusting her and caring for her. She ended up moving in. We lived together for roughly a year. Every day she went to the gas station just outside my neighborhood, and begged for money. She earned enough to buy cigarettes and beer. She was a bad drunk, though. She would get drunk and leave for days. I knew she was doing drugs when she left. But, I always let her back in. We weren't romantically involved. She was very ugly, and hard to look at. Years on the street took it's toll on her. She wanted me to get physically close to her, but I couldn't. I was not interested in her sexually.  I couldn't respond to her sexually, and it bothered her. It hurt her, and she told me so. When I moved to Georgia, I had to leave her behind.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>My father was brutal with his physical punshment. One time when I was 8 we were all camping. I had done something that upset my dad. He was drunk at the time (practically all the time). He grabbed my throat and smacked me around so bad I fell to the ground. Then he started kicking me. The campers next to us ran over. The man put himself between me and my father. The woman bent down to help me, screaming, "Stop! You're killing him." My t-shirt was full of blood and I was badly scratched up. The woman took me back to her camp while they waited for the park rangers. The park rangers talked to my dad, and told him to leave the next day. I was afraid to go near my dad after that.</p>
                                <p>Whenever I got into a fight growing up, I would beat the hell out of the other kid, the same way my father beat me. I would bang their head against the ground saying "I'll kill you. I'll kill you.", over and over, until I was pulled off the other person. Many times I was in a blackout state. My friends had to tell me about it.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">FORGOTTEN GOOD TIMES</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>I know not all my childhood was full of tragic experiences, though. There were plenty of good times. My sisters and I went camping with our father every year. We had an Aunt and Uncle that loved us. My Grandmother and Grandfather were very loving. The safest place I ever knew was in their house. My Grandmother excepted me completely. She never turned her back on me. I never had to earn her love. She was my rock when I was a child. Since her death, I have not been able to feel as safe as I did when she was alive.</p>
                                <p>I wish I could concentrate on the good times, but it seems it's the worse moments that I focus on. Especially, in the mornings when I first wake up. I hate the world, first thing in the morning. I'm the most critical of myself, and my loved one's. It takes hours before I start to settle down. I don't understand it.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">APPRECIATION FOR YOU, DOCTOR ADAMSON.</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Doctor Adamson, thank you for reading this through. You have made a difference, by listening, understanding, asking questions, giving me your interpretations, and helping me with the extra's, like benefits. I've needed someone to hear me, and understand what I've been through. I've kept some of these experiences to myself for so long. I need someone to hear what happened. I need someone to listen. I need to invalidate the thoughts, without invaliding myself. I may have to repeat my stories a few times, so I can start to accept a new way to look at them. I'm willing to have the conversations. I am unable to just think my way out of it with CBT. I'm subject to the judgment of my conscious.</p>
                                <p>Doc, I don't want to quit. I really don't. I just don't know why I shouldn't. Of course, I will go back to work, eventually. I'll get my own place, again. I will pay my debts, over time. But, the world is nothing but hurtful. I don't want to engage with it anymore. I really can't take much more of this life.</p>
