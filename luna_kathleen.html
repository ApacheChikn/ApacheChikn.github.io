                                <p>You recommended that I write down my thoughts, and my experiences behind them. Well, it wasn't easy for me to do. I find myself waking up everyday with thoughts like these, and ruminating over past experiences like these. They aren't the only ones, though. I have endured a lot more than is written here.</p>
                                <p>You are the only person outside of my psychologist I have ever shared these experiences & photos with. Seriously, the only one. I shared the photos because it's important to see certain things for yourself, and since you're a nurse I imagine you have seen worse. I went back and forth with whether I should share it with you because it is so humiliating.</p><p>I think unburdening myself is worth it.</p>

                                <p>I'm going to share why:</p>
                                <ul><li>I am unwanted.</li>
                                    <li>I am neglected.</li>
                                    <li>I am undesirable.</li>
                                    <li>I am rejected.</li>
                                    <li>I am inadequate.</li>

                                <p>To start, I'm a fucking loser. I need to accept it. In life there are winner's and loser's. I'm the later.</p>
                                <p>I have nothing to offer. I am unemployed, in debt, have a history of substance abuse, have a history of mental health problems, have a history of incarceration, and I haven't accumulated anything tangible, or intangible.</p>
                                <p>I'm a burden because I am putting my family, and friends, in a situation where I have had to depend on them, for way too long. They are running out of patience and generosity.</p>
                                <p>I'm unattractive because, on a superficial level, I'm just plain ugly; Inside too.</p>
                                <p>I have nothing to offer a woman because, all I am is a 'nice guy', and that's worthless. I get stepped on, because of it. I get taken advantage of, because of it. I'm a sucker because I'm codependent, I do whatever someone wants me to do. I get lied to and put up with it, because I'm desperate for companionship. I put up with things I shouldn't, because I am pathetic. I stink of desperation because, I am desperate. People can tell when someone is desperate for friendship, or a romantic relationship. It turns them off. They don't want to attempt a friendship, or any type of relationship, because I will be clingy.</p>
                                <p>I'm broken because so many hurtful things have affected me, and I can't seem to move past them. I'm not worth making a personal investment in. Who would want to have a relationship with a man who does nothing but fail on every level?</p>
                                <p>I have failed. I am failure.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">LONELINESS & MOLESTATION</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>Most of my life I have felt loneliness. If I had to guess when I first felt loneliness, I would say when I was removed from my home and put in a group home. I was separated from my mother and 3 sisters. I was 4 years old. I wasn't in the group home long before a foster family took me in. I spent a short period of time in the first home, before I was placed in another home, where my sisters were. Apparently, it wasn't easy to find a foster family that would take 4 children at once. My youngest sister was around 6 months old. We spent 2 years with the foster family. Really bad things happened there.</p>
                                <p>The foster family consisted of Eddy, Martha, and Eddy Jr. Then there was us four. And, from time to time, at least one or two other kids would cycle through for a couple days, up to a few months. One of the boys that came through, molested me for months. I was four and he was fifteen. He liked to watch wrestling on tv, then act like he was a wrestler. He would pin me down on my stomach with my arms back between his knees, so I couldn't move. Then he would lay on my back enough to pull my underwear down. He would rub his penis into my butt cheeks. He would penetrate my anus. He would always ejaculate in me or on my butt cheeks before he got off of me, then threatening me. I would stay frozen until he left, and eventually I would get up. There was shit on me and when I pulled up my underwear I would feel this sticky stuff on my butt. I thought he had spit on me, until I was older, and truly understood what he did. I would get severly punished for soiling my underwear. Martha would take my dirty underwear, put the shit stain up to my nose, and rub it in. I was then stripped naked and put into the garage, no lights on, with the underwear on my head, for hours.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I have felt loneliness most of my life. It causes me physical pain in my chest. If I were to shoot myself, it would be in the heart, because that's where I hurt the most. Loneliness causes me to cry often, so I find a place that's private and cry, while telling myself I'm worthless and stupid. That's because I am.</p>
                                <p>My mother told me more than once, when I was a child, "You will end up alone. You're going to be a hermit."</p>

                            <div class="position-relative mb-4">

                                <h5 class="mb-1">ROTTING</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I was 9, my mother started neglecting me; differently than usual. She stopped taking care of me. I didn't get showers, and I didn't wear clean clothes. I started to smell bad. It went on so long that the skin on my feet started to rot, and shed off, my hair started falling out, and I developed a very large and itchy rash on the inside of my left groin. My father came to pick us up for our summer camping trip. He smelt me and asked why I stink. My oldest sister told him, "Mom doesn't care anymore about Shawn." When he confronted my mother, she told him, "He's your son. You take care of him." My father took me to a doctor after the vacation. I had to take time off from school to clear up. I ended up having to rub a lotion on my head, and wear a shower cap to stop my hair from falling out any further. I couldn't wear shoes for awhile, and had to rub a cream on them, then wear socks only. I got a shot, and had to put calamine lotion on the rash, until it went away; which took a very long time. I was constantly scratching it and making it bleed. When I went to therapy back in 1995, the therapist told me that I represented my father to my mother. She treated me poorly to get back at him.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>My father was brutal with physical punishment. One time when I was 8 we were all camping. I had thrown trash into our camp fire, and that upset my dad. He was drunk at the time (practically all the time). He grabbed my throat and smacked me around so bad I fell to the ground. Then he started kicking me. The campers next to us ran over. The woman bent down to help me, screaming, "Stop! You're killing him." The man put himself between me and my father. My t-shirt was full of blood. I thought I was going to die. The woman took me back to her camp while they waited for the park rangers. The park rangers talked to my dad, and told him to leave the next day. I was afraid to go near my dad after that.</p>
                                <p>Whenever I got into a fight growing up, I would beat the hell out of the other kid, the same way my father beat me that day. I would bang their head against the ground yelling, "I'll kill you. I'll kill you.", over and over, until I was pulled off the other person. Most of the time I blacked out. My friends had to tell me what I did.</p>
                                <p>One time I was expelled from school for a week, because I got into a fight on the playground, and cussed out the teacher. I was only in the first grade. When I got home, my mother sat me in a chair in the middle of my room. I had to sit upright. She tied my legs and arms to the chair. I was crying and begging her to let me out. She put duct tape over my mouth, so she wouldn't have to hear me crying. She left the room and closed the door. She did this often as a punishment.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">TAKING RISKS WITH LOVE IN MIND</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>When I lived in Mobile, Alabama, I went to Mardi Gras every year. One year, all my friends called it a night and went home. I drove a friend home, then went back to the party, in downtown Mobile. I pulled up in front of a bar, and parked my car. A homeless man staying in the park across the street approached me. He asked if he could sit in my car to stay warm while I was in the bar, because it was so cold out. I told him to come inside with me and have a drink. While we were drinking I learned that he was a decent guy. I offered him to come home with me and get out of the cold for the night, have something to eat, and in the morning I would drive him back to the park. He used the spare bedroom in my house. My sister was living with me at the time. She thought I was crazy, but it all worked out.</p>
                                <p>My oldest sister, who was living with me, was an alcoholic, and did drugs. She would hang out with some questionable women. She told me some of them would prostitute themselves, because they had drug habits. One day a girl knocked on the door looking for my sister, but my sister wasn't home. I recognized the girl as one my sister pointed out to me. I told her if she ever needed a safe place for the night she could come in and eat, shower, wash her clothes, and rest. I told her my sister and I would make sure nothing happened to her. She asked me what I wanted. I told her I didn't want anything, but drug use was not allowed in my house. She left, but came back another night, and took me up on my offer. Soon it got around what I did, and other girls started showing up looking for a safe place. I never accepted sex as payment. Some of the girls would offer me sex, though. I told them they could clean the bathroom, clean the stove, do my laundry, but I wasn't accepting sex. I told them they could get off the street for a night and watch TV with me, that's it. I was lonely and wanted the company.</p>
                                <p>When I lived in Florida, I met a girl named Kim. She would always approach me at the grocery store in the parking lot, and beg for money. I would never give her any money. Then one trip to the store she started talking to me. I learned a little bit about her. I offered her an opportunity to come home with me after my shopping was done, and get off the street for a day. She took me up on it. She washed her clothes, ate, showered, and slept in my guest bedroom. I took her back to the parking lot the next day. This happened more and more, and we became friends, and I started trusting her, and caring about her. She ended up moving in. We lived together for roughly a year. Every day she went to the gas station just outside my neighborhood, and begged for money. She earned enough to buy cigarettes and beer. She was a bad drunk, though. She would get drunk and leave for days. I knew she was doing drugs when she left. But, I always let her back in. We weren't romantically involved; I didn't want that. I knew she prostituted herself to get her drugs. When I moved to Georgia, I had to leave her behind.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">POSITIVE vs. NEGATIVE COMMENTS</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2"></p>
                                <p>I have a problem with accepting compliments. Why am I supposed to accept compliments as true, and insults as false? I'm told that the negative comments are to be ignored, and the compliments are to be accepted. The negative comments are the truest. Positive compliments are phony. How can someone who doesn't know me ever give me a genuine compliment? They can't. If I haven't EARNED compliments, then they are not real. They shouldn't just be handed out. You may ask why that doesn't apply to negative comments. People don't have to know someone very well to make a negative comment. A negative comment is supported by the evidence of how the world responds to me. So, trying to tell myself something that goes against the evidence is useless. It is better to accept the truth, and then I can stop the struggle of opposing thoughts. Acceptance is the way out.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1">I'M PHYSICALLY INADEQUATE</h5>
                                <p class="mb-2">because I was born stunted and puny (an anatomical deformity).</p>
                                <p>I was born with a deformity called "micro penis", due to my mother having hormone issues during her pregnancy with me. Her hormone issues caused me a hormone issue I did not grow out of. In addition to that, the lower ring of my inguinal canal, on the right side of my abdomen, did not close off. The spermatic cord attached to the right testicle didn't develop properly. This causes my right testicle to rise up, through the inguinal canal, and stay in my abdomen, which can look like I don't have testicles, and is very painful. (Photos on Target Behavior page)</p>
                                <p>If I find the courage to have the conversation with a woman about my condition, I suffer tremendous anxiety, and I am embarrassed, regardless. I'm always prepared to be rejected, because I have been, numerous times.</p>

A couple times she said to me, -You'll never get a girlfriend with that,- pointing to my penis. One time when I was 10, I was wearing one of her wigs and her shoes, walking around naked in the house. She took a polariod of me. When her friends came over she would show them the photo. The comments I heard always made me cry, even though I didn't quite understand why it mattered. All I knew is they were laughing at me. I never ran around naked again. <br><br>When I was on the swim team in high school we had to wear speedos. You couldn't tell I was a boy. I looked like a woman wearing only a bikini bottom. I was on the swim team for three years, and some guys often made fun of me. I didn't return my senior year, because I had enough of it. <br><br>My first sexual experience was with, Eleanor Morna Palmer. She already had sex with a couple of her boyfriends, but I was still a virgin. She wanted to be my first and take my virginity. She made me feel so stupid for trusting her, though. Our first, and only time together, she kept saying, -I can't feel you. Are you inside me?- She was trying to make me feel bad. She was intentionally cruel. She let everyone know my penis was too small to feel. <br><br>When I left for the Marine Corps boot camp, and during the 16 weeks of training, my girlfriend, Kelly, broke up with me. When I returned home and found out we weren't a couple anymore, I learned she had told everyone how she put up with my -tiny dick for too long.- <br><br>While in boot camp, we all had to shower together. I had a chance to see other men naked, and I immediately knew, just how deficient I was. Some of the guys would point and laugh. I would try to turn and hide myself. <br><br>When I was on the U.S.S. Saipan, during a Mediterranean Float, another Marine had been in the head showering at the same time as me. He needed to pass by when I was drying myself off. I stood up to let him go by me, but he cupped my crotch, and said, -Very cute-, as he was passing. I just froze, like I did in the foster home. I went back into the shower stall, and had a heart attack. He was gay and I believe his intention was to humilate me. <br><br>I met a girl one night at a bar, and we hit it off. We got drunk, then went to my apartment for casual sex. We got undressed together, and when she saw me naked, she laughed and started getting dressed. I asked her what was wrong. She said, -I can't go through with it. I can't do anything with that,- pointing at my penis. I gave her a ride back to her dorm and left feeling humiliated. <br><br>I had a girlfriend, Amye Lee Strange, whom I fell in love with. She and I dated for over a year. One day my insecurity got the better of me, and I asked if she was satisfied with our sex life. She said it was okay, but she missed feeling a man inside her. It hurt so bad to hear that. I was devastated. I imagine it is how all women feel when they have sex with me. <br><br>After college I was seeing a girl, Leslie Rene Hagler. We would get drunk and fool around. We went to a party at her friends house, which was a three hours drive from Mobile. We spent the night, because of the distance. I got drunk, went to bed, and passed out. Leslie pulled the sheets off me, then slipped my underwear off, while I was unconscious. She played some really loud music in the room and woke me up. She was with two of her girlfriends, standing next to the bed looking at me, and laughing. Leslie was saying, -See, I told you he don't have a dick.- The ride home was awkward. She kept apologizing and blaming it on being drunk. <br><br>My girlfriend, Gale, whom I had been dating for roughly three months, came to me and asked for an open relationship. She wanted to go with another guy we both knew, and told me I could go with other women. I asked why she would want that. She said, -You're a really nice guy, Shawn. You give me everything, except in bed, and I need that.- I told her I wasn't going to have an open relationship. It would be too painful for me to think about her having sex with someone else. I told her to break up with me and go her way. She stayed another two weeks, until I found out she was cheating on me. <br><br>When I lived in Florida, I went to the VA Clinic for a rash on my left groin. The nurse came in to look at it, and brought another nurse into the room with her. The rule was that a female nurse couldn't be in a room with a male patient, without another nurse there to witness. I had to lower my pants for her to see the rash. When I dropped my underwear to show her the rash they both started to giggle. The witness nurse covered her mouth, and turned around, because she couldn't wipe the smile off her face. <br><br>Cathlean Charmaine Robinson, was a black woman I worked with. We talked on the phone a few times, before we started meeting after work. She was in a bad situation. She had a serious drinking problem. She had received two DUI's in one week. She was spending her weekends in jail, and she couldn't afford a lawyer. I offered her an opportunity because I am a desperate man. I told her I was lonely, and I liked her company. I would help her financially, if she would spend more time with me. She accepted my offer. We spent enough time together that I developed feelings for her. One night I went to kiss her, and she jumped back shocked. I told her I was interested in having a physical relationship. She didn't want that with me, because she thought I would be clingy. A few weeks later, we got drunk and had sex. When we got undressed she looked at me like -WTF-. She said, -I know I'm not going to get anything out of this. Let's get it over with.- I was embarrassed and felt like a loser. She ended up making excuses for not coming over anymore. <br><br>My last girlfriend, Shavonne Elaine Giles, was more than four years ago. She too, is a black woman. She was a cook at the Waffle House, where I would eat often, not too far from where I was staying. We hit it off and started seeing each other. It was a couple of months into the relationship before we tried to have sex. She was disappointed with it, and let me know. She commented to me that -She knew white guys were small, but not that small.- I ignored the comment because I was so desperate to have someone in my life. We went shopping for adult toys shortly after our first time together; she insisted. The size of the toys she would pick out made me feel ashamed. It was all she ever wanted me to use on her, from then on. I always felt bad about myself, because I couldn't satisfy her traditionally. Sometimes she didn't even reciprocate sexually. We stayed together for over a year. I think it lasted that long because I was paying her rent, and buying her groceries. I ended up buying a second car, so she could drive herself to work, instead of paying for rides. The relationship ended shortly after the car purchase. <br><br>These experiences weren't simply hurtful. Some of the women intentionally caused me pain and shame. I was crushed every time. I'm not a man with an average sized penis and a self-image issue. I have a deformity. <br><br>I spent a lot of time drunk and high to work up the courage to approach women. It helped me to overcome my insecurity. <br><br>There were several times in my life that I considered cutting off my testicles, which I though would kill my libido, which would stop me from seeking out physical relationships. Several times I even tied rubberbands around them, to make them hurt, because I hated them. I would stand in front of the mirror naked and tell myself -You're a fucking loser. Give it up.- -No one wants you. Just kill yourself.- I take stick matches, light the head of the match, blow it out, then stick it into my pubic area (Photos on Target Behavior page). I do this to remove the feeling of being touched, and to scar myself to keep myself from trying anymore. <br><br>I was mortified every time I was rejected for my deformity, and my self-esteem was destroyed. I AM inadequate, in more than one way. I always have been. My whole life I have been. It's not just my crotch. I understand that there are other ways to please a woman. There's romance, spending more time on foreplay, oral sex, toys, and positions. I can hide my deformity in a pair of pants. But, I can't hide the other stuff. I'm a fucking loser. I'm not going to bullshit myself. <br><br>Can you believe that someone could do such things to another person. They do, and worse. I hate myself for being a piece of shit. <br><br>I explained my deformity, so you would understand the reactions I received. <br><br>Thank you for understanding. If I offended you, I am sorry. I just want someone to understand some of why I am, and where I am. <br><br><br>Scroll back up to the BUTTON you clicked to make this text disappear.";

                                <p class="mb-2">I served in the Marine Corps during the Gulf War. I was a mortarman in an 81mm Mortar Platoon. Mortars are directly behind the Line Company (the rifleman platoons). After firefights, the Line Company would move forward to continue engaging with the enemy. The Mortar Platoon would sweep in where the Line Company was. When we arrive we clear bunkers of hiding enemy and wounded. We take live enemy as prisoners and round them up for the MP's to roll in and remove them to the rear.</p><p>There are bodies mutilated from the mortar explosions. Mortars destroy the human body. Some are missing legs, arms, heads, torsos, etc. The bodies are recovered after Head Quarters rolls in. While clearing bunkers we would proceed cautiously into the hole, to remove survivors. We would give them aid if needed and arrest them. While clearing bunkers with my squad, two Marines were mistreating the prisoners. They were also being disrepectful to the dead by spitting on them and kicking bodies. I should have spoken up and stopped them, or reported them to the Command. I didn't, though. I was scared of being ostricized, made to look untrustworthy. I was also concerned for my safety. So, I said nothing. It still bothers me today that I didn't have the integrity to speak up; to put a stop to it. I am less of a man for it.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">After removing survivors from the bunkers we would pull out the bodies of the dead. When removing a dead Iraqi, I found a photo under his body. It was a beaten up picture of a young boy. I figure it was the soldiers son, I don't know. Today, more than 30 years later, that boy haunts my dreams. He asks why I killed his father.</p><br><p>I don't know anymore, why I killed his father. When I was in high school and considering enlisting, I wanted to kill people. I wanted to do what my father did in Vietnam. Kill the enemy. Today I am not proud of the desire to kill that I had in my teens. I'm disgusted with myself for ever thinking in such a way.</p>

Especially, in the mornings when I first wake up. I hate the world, first thing in the morning. I hate myself, as soon as my eyes open. I'm the most critical of myself, and my loved one's then. It takes hours before I start to settle down. I don't understand it.</p>
